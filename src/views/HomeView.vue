    <h3>Webdock</h3>
    <p>My work on developing Webdocks' new landing pages and building the theme for the dashboard post-login, I utilized my deep expertise in PHP, JavaScrip, HTML, and CSS. I created dynamic and responsive user interfaces that provided a seamless and enjoyable experience for our users. In collaboration with external UI & UX designers, I ensured that our platform was not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitive and easy to navigate. This collaboration helped ensure that the design of our landing pages and dashboard aligned with the latest trends and best practices in user interface design.  As part of my bachelor project, I was responsible for designing and implementing a new purchasing flow that allowed customers to configure their desired servers efficiently. This required not only technical skills but also a thorough understanding of user needs and purchasing behavior. Through this process, I was able to demonstrate my abilities in project management, problem identification and resolution, and communication with stakeholders across various fields.</p>

    <h3>Danpanel</h3>
    <p>Throughout the development of Danpanel's new website in WordPress, my skills in WordPress development saw significant growth. I was responsible for the development of their new website in WordPress. In addition to the development itself, I also had the freedom to choose styling, UX (user experience), UI (user interface), and create a style guide. This allowed me to create a website that not only met their technical requirements but also reflected their brand identity and delivered a high-quality user experience. I took into account both aesthetics and functionality to ensure that the website was easy to navigate, visually appealing, and met the users' needs. As I navigated the development of their new website, I encountered various challenges and opportunities that allowed me to expand my proficiency in WordPress.</p>
